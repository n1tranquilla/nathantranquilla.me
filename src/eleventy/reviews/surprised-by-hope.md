I happened upon Surprised by Hope after first reading How God became King, another of N.T. Wright's books, which helped me understand the eschatological and theological framework that he works with, and in which he expounds the great hope of the Christian faith, which is the content of the present book. It is in How God became King, that he talks about the Kingdom of God; in Surprised by Hope, the resurrection; and in the Day the Revolution Began, the crucifixion, the last of which I am very excited to be reading and will soon follow up with a review. 

The Resurrection of Jesus Christ and the surprising hope it offers for this present world until new creation, is the topic of this book. I find it hard to summarize this contents of the book, so I think I will use a different tact and highlight some of the high points.

## Dualism
We often think of the gospel as teaching about "how we go to heaven" with the goal of being "snatched away from this earth". One of the main themes underlying this book is "heaven coming to earth" as the hope of the gospel. That this earth will be made new, not thrown away, that God will return to remake the creation, not destroy it, that what he made will be affirmed, not rejected, that heaven will be united with earth, underpins this whole book. 

Wright explores the metaphors in the New Testament which affirm this viewpoint, for example "new birth" in passages such as Romans 8, where the creation stands in relation to the new creation as a mother in the birth pangs. There is continuity for the new from the old, and yet there is suffering the present until it is realized suddenly in the future. 

But as it related to dualism, Wright rejects the idea that we will one day be snatched away from the earth and instead affirms the viewpoint that heaven will be united with earth, when the Lord returns to rule the earth. As it relates to the later half of the book, it is this lopsided dualism of the familiar gospel message that keeps us from the larger gospel effort, and keeps us from beginning to realize some of God's future purposes for this world, now in the present.
