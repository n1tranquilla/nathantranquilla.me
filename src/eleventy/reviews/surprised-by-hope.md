I happened upon _Surprised by Hope_ after first reading _How God became King_, another of N.T. Wright's books, which helped me understand the eschatological and theological framework that he works with, and in which he expounds the great hope of the Christian faith, which is the content of the present book. It is in _How God became King_, that he talks about the Kingdom of God; in _Surprised by Hope_, the resurrection; and in _The Day the Revolution Began_, the crucifixion, the last of which I am very excited to be reading and will soon follow up with a review. Being a difficult book to summarize, I will leave you with the thoughts that linger in my mind having finished reading the book. 

What I have walked away with is wonderment and hope for this present world. Having understood that the resurrection of Jesus Messiah is a kind of ahead-of-schedule resurrection, or _firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep_, or a kind of present realization of God's future purposes in the present, or a kind of blueprint or promise of how God intents to renew the entire creation, an event marking a new age in which things are already beginning to be made new, that I now live with God's spirit in me, possessing the same essence of power that raised Jesus from the dead, and who lives in a body that death cannot touch - it is because of all of these thoughts that I'm excited at the possibilities of new life in me personally, and the possibility of being an agent of new life in my own community, in ways I hadn't previously imagined.

The question that really lingers for me is this: if God has already begun to realize his purposes for the future in the present through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, how might we also be used to realize God's plans for the future now, we who have been filled with the same Spirit?
