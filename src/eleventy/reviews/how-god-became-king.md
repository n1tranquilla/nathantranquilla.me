What was the story the gospel writers were trying to tell? Many believers affirm the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, but might have trouble answering this question of why he _lived_ and why so much time is spent talking about the "middle parts" between virgin birth and crucifixion. 

_How God Became King_ starts with an examination into all the answers we have supplied to this question, where they fall short, and reframes our thinking based on four truths of which the Western Church has lost sight. Namely, (1) that the gospel stories tell the story of Israel with it's climax reached in the Messiah, Jesus, (2) the story of Israel's God coming back to be with his people as he had always promised, (3) the story of God launching a renewed people, and finally (4) the story of how his kingdom clashed with that of Caesar. It is in light of these four truths that he helps us understand that the gospel narratives are really telling the story of _How God Became King_ of Israel, and king over the nations. 

Having adjusted each to their proper volume, what these truths help us understand is how all notions of kingdom are redefined in the kingdom that was inaugurated by the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. What is brought into central focus is kingdom and cross - how does the cross bring the kingdom, or could the kingdom have come without the cross? What he shows is that necessary link between the two, not only in scripture concerning the Messiah, as the those on the road to Emmaus would learn (_"Was it not necessary that the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?"_), but in the lives of believers who further the kingdom, picking up their crosses and following him. 

What is clearly brought into focus is the call to take up the cross and follow Jesus, patterned by his own life, to further his kingdom here on earth, so that God's will is done here as in heaven. And what the fourth speaker shows us is that his kingdom is entirely different than those of the world around us, not supplanting one oppressive empire with another of the same kind, but with one whose power is with the servant, whose sword is truth, and whose strength is love.

Where this book stops short is answering the question of what's next. It more or less lays the groundwork for correcting our thinking that we will one day be snatched away from this earth (cross without kingdom) or that our mission is the social-gospel agenda (kingdom without cross). This is a must-read for anyone hungering for their true purpose.
