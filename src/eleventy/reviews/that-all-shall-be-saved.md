_That All shall be saved_ by David Bentley Hart is series of four meditations, of a philosophical, logical, and scriptural nature, that answer, to the author's satisfaction, the two main questions he have bothered him through the years concerning the variations of "infernalism". Can a finite, rational creature freely reject God, and to do so with eternal finality, and can a God who creates a world where the possibility of eternal, undending torment be not only be good, but the essence of Good itself?

I will try to provide a brief summary of each meditation, as I understand them. From Hart's perspective, these meditation should be immediately obvious if it for the hardening of various systematic beliefs around the time of Augustine, and thereafter. However, he does engage with various of them deeply to try and expose the contradictions that exist in "inferanlist" belief system, which can make for a difficult read, if not for the logical content, then for his expansive vocabulary. 

## Who is God? The moral meaning of _creatio ex nihilo_
This meditation starts from what it must mean for God, who is the Good in himself, to create something from nothing. The nature of evil is discussed as not originating from God, and so, being privative (what's there when good isn't), will vanish when the redemption of this world is over. So far, the story ought to sound familiar to the vast majority who hold a christian belief. 

But what does it mean for God when his final judgement is revealed and we discover that the eternal suffering of inviduals (by their choice or not) is how the story ends. Is what God created truly good, if the tragedy of lost souls was even a possibility in the premise of his creative act?

Hart beliefs are unambiguous.

> If God is the good creator of all, he must also be the saviour of all, without fail, who brings to himself all that he has made, including all rational wills.

## What is a person? A reflection on the Divine Image
The heart of this meditation is to show that there is no way in which a person can be saved, except they are saved with along with all other people. This did not seem obvious to me at first, but the argument is crystal clear and extrodinarily simple. 

As I understand it, how would heaven be a place without sorrow or suffering if even the loved ones of people you loved were lost? Or loved ones, of loved ones of people you loved we lost. Or God forbid, your own loved ones? 

How could we ever become so callous as to forget them? Would forgetting, growing callous, or letting go of love and compassion be consistent with our salvation? Is this not the corruption of our own souls? Would we have to ignore the suffering of potentially the entire human race (including ignoring the suffering of people who have lost loved ones)? Would this not make heaven a place of "every soul for himself", which, as Hart points out, is the ethos of hell? W

Would a heavenly lobotomy ("a piece of the mind for peace of mind") which erases all memory of the damned still leave you intact as a person? Who are you, if you are not made and formed the people you love, and are forced to let go of you deapest loves through erasure of the mind? Would you still be you at all? Why would we speak of salvation if what makes you "you" is an entire replacement of who you are. 

> Is this, then, our choice after all: either a hell of eternal torment or a heaven that is the annihilation of everything that ever made us who we were?

The section ends with an especially poignant statement

> I am not I in myself alone, but only in all others. If, then, anyone is in hell, I am partly in hell too.
