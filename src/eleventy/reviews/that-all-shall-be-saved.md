That all shall be saved is not a book to read without a dictionary near at a hand. David Bentley Hart's style philosophical style can be difficult to grok at times (pun absolutely intended). 

His introduction is spent mostly casting doubt on some of the more traiditional justifications raised by proponents of infernalism amoung various sects of Christianity. He also clearly states his bias and warns the readers that he intends to unapolegitically state his points in favor of universalism. His confidence and style, i'm sure, come across as either confidence or arrogance, depending on which side of the debate you find yourself on. 

Hart emphasizes many times throughout the book that although he goes into great philosophical and logical detail, many of the thoughts are very simple and should be easily summarized. So instead of going into detail on each section, i'll try to provide my own summary.

The meat of the book unfolds in four meditations.

## Who is God? The moral meaning of _creatio ex nihilo_
The argument proceeds on implications of what it must mean for God to have created something from nothing (_ex nihilo_). If God creates from nothing, then what results must be good, since what he creates comes from Him. The end of the redemption story must result in the defeat of evil and the complete triumph of good. While evil lingers now, we cannot judge the story until the end, since redemption is underway. However, if evil lingers eternally, it would because of God's creative act, which cannot be. The eternal suffering of the damned is an unspeakable evil (or tragedy) that would not have been (free will or not) without God's creative act. And so it must be that in the ages to come, all will be reconciled to God.
