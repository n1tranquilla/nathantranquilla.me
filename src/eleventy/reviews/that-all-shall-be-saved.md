_That All shall be saved_ by David Bentley Hart is series of four meditations, of a philosophical, logical, and scriptural nature, that answer, to the author's satisfaction, the two main questions he have bothered him through the years concerning the variations of "infernalism". Can a finite, rational creature freely reject God, and to do so with eternal finality, and can a God who creates a world where the possibility of eternal, unending torment be not only be good, but the essence of Good itself?

I will try to provide a brief summary of each meditation, as I understand them. From Hart's perspective, these meditation should be immediately obvious if it for the hardening of various systematic beliefs around the time of Augustine, and thereafter. However, he does engage with various of them deeply to try and expose the contradictions that exist in "infernalist" belief system, which can make for a difficult read, if not for the logical content, then for his expansive vocabulary. 

## Who is God? The moral meaning of _creatio ex nihilo_
This meditation starts from what it must mean for God, who is the Good in himself, to create something from nothing. The nature of evil is discussed as not originating from God, and so, being privative (what's there when good isn't), will vanish when the redemption of this world is over. So far, the story ought to sound familiar to the vast majority who hold a christian belief. 

But what does it mean for God when his final judgement is revealed and we discover that the eternal suffering of individuals (by their choice or not) is how the story ends. Is what God created truly good, if the tragedy of lost souls was even a possibility in the premise of his creative act?

Hart beliefs are unambiguous.

> If God is the good creator of all, he must also be the saviour of all, without fail, who brings to himself all that he has made, including all rational wills.

But how does God save all, when each has their own rational will? This is the subject of his fourth meditation.

## What is judgement? A reflection on biblical eschatology 
In this meditation, Hart considers generally the metaphors about judgement in the gospels (chaff, ovens, Gehenna, sealed doors of wedding feasts, imprisonment), and talks about Matthew 25:46 in particular. He then compares them to other passages, mostly in the Pauline epistles that seem to favour universalism. These verses, he argues, are more explicit that the metaphors used largely in the gospels. 

He then talks about the eschatological system he holds personally which accounts for the seemingly contradicting views concerning judgement, one that he borrows from Gregory of Nyssa and Origin. I'll let the reader discover that for themselves, but as a hint, the differing views of judgment are two eschatological horizons, one contained within the other. 

If you are looking for a satisfactory explanation on Revelation, you won't find it here. Hart finds it problematic to draw any kind of doctrine out of the imagery of Revelation, and believes the key to its interpretation has long been lost. He does not even believe that the book of Revelation concerns the end times. But to those who do interpret this book as speaking about the final separation between the saved and the damned, he points out that the last chapter represents a paradox as the new Age is one in which the doors of Jerusalem are opened and those who have been formerly excluded are invited to wash their garments, enter the city, and drink of the waters of life. 

## What is a person? A reflection on the Divine Image
The heart of this meditation is to show that there is no way in which a person can be saved, except they are saved along with all other people. This did not seem obvious to me at first, but the argument is extraordinarily simple. 

As I understand the argument, how would heaven be a place without sorrow or suffering if even the loved ones of people you loved were lost? Or loved ones, of loved ones of people you loved we lost. Or God forbid, your own loved ones? 

How could we ever become so callous as to forget them? Would forgetting, growing callous, or letting go of love and compassion be consistent with our salvation? Is this not the corruption of our own souls? Would we have to ignore the suffering of potentially the entire human race (including ignoring the suffering of people who have lost loved ones)? Would this not make heaven a place of "every soul for himself", which, as Hart points out, is the ethos of hell?

Would a heavenly lobotomy ("a piece of the mind for peace of mind") which erases all memory of the damned still leave you intact as a person? Who are you, if you are not made and formed by the people you love, and are forced to let go of you deepest loves through erasure of the mind? Would you still be you at all? Why would we speak of salvation if what makes you "you" is an entire replacement of who you are. 

> Is this, then, our choice after all: either a hell of eternal torment or a heaven that is the annihilation of everything that ever made us who we were?

The section ends with an especially poignant statement:

> I am not I in myself alone, but only in all others. If, then, anyone is in hell, I am partly in hell too.

## What is freedom? A reflection on the rational will
This meditation addresses what it means to be free, and if eternal rejection of God is possible for the rational will. For Hart, to be free is to possess complete knowledge and sanity (knowing what is good and not being insane so as to deliberately choose what is bad). Anyone with consciousness has at least some liberty (is able to see somewhat clearly and has the sanity to choose good so far as they know), but by the same token no one, except one with complete knowledge and sanity of mind, is truly free. 

This isn't a big surprise in most christian beliefs."Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin" - John 8:34. In other words, from Hart's perspective, if you do something that hurts you, it's because you are not truly free (lacking in complete perspective, or sanity). In Hart's mind, it is knowing the truth and the ability to choose it that sets you free. "You will know the truth, and the truth will set you free" - John 8:32

To skip to the end (read the book), it is Hart's conclusion that the only natural end of the will (if not in this age, then in the ages to come) when all is revealed, is to choose the Good, although there is certainly room for deviations from it in the meantime. This is analogous, in his mind, to saying that the only natural end of the intellect is Truth. 

But the most interesting part, for me, comes from a meditation on Jesus Christ himself; could it have been possible for Jesus Christ to freely reject the will of the Father? The answer is no, unequivocally, and no potential latency in his will to do so. If we say he had even potential to disobey his Father, then how would he be the perfect expression of the Image of God? On the other hand, perhaps being God, he could not disobey, but being human, could he have? That would undermine the claim that he was one person, not two competing wills between the divine and the human will.

It is a contradiction then, to say that a truly free human will could reject God, because Jesus Christ had a truly free (knowing all things, and having a sane mind to choose the Good) human will, and could not have rejected the will of the Father. 

Could we say, Hart continues, that there was something absent about his humanity that is present in ours? But he makes a good point: if he had no capacity to sin as free human being, then sin is a stain on the human will, one that will vanish when all is revealed and the human will eventually chooses the Good, if not in this life, then in the ages to come. 

This particular part of the meditation requires some deeper thought that other parts, but I really appreciated seeing the contradiction. And the conclusion is that accident upon humanity, privative in nature, and that one day, when the ages are done, all human will will see clearly and choose the Good. And then, and only then, God will be all in all (he will be all in every person), as the argument goes.

## Conclusion
I have skipped over much of the interesting points of this book. There are many other interesting topics covered including in depth discussion of 1 Corinthians 15, and election in Romans, and much more. There is also a fair amount of early church history mentioned in the book. I would recommend _Universalism: The prevailing doctrine of the Christian church for the first 500 years_.
