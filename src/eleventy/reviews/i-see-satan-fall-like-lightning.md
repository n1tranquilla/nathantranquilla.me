I See Satan Fall like lightning is first and foremost a anthropological study of biblical texts and Christian traditions. His goal is to show the unique role of the Gospel texts in exposing the parasite of satanic power on human order from the foundation of the first human society, through the persecution of the prophets, to finally the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. His method is to show the biblical tradition of exposing human violence in siding with, and telling of the story of the victim. In contrast, he shows that it is exactly the hidden story of the victim that otherwise produces mythology in the ancient world (there are a few examinations of myths). Girard finds in the Gospel narratives the secret hidden in mythology and human religious ritual - hidden violent social order resulting from rivalry between individuals and communities that periodically expels itself on a scapegoat victim. It is the revelation of violent social order inherent in the "principalities and powers" and the "prince of this world" found uniquely in the Gospel texts, that Girard uses to account for the modern disintegration of archaic religion and the modern concern for victims.

I will summarize each chapter to provide a general outline of his case.

## Chapter 1 _Scandal must come_
Girard begins with what the tenth commandment signals; the prohibition to covet what your neighbor has is to deal with desire directly. It is desire of what your neighbor has, or desire for what your neighbor desires, that produces rivalry in human communities. If rivalry goes unchecked, in threatens the peace of a community. And so the tenth commandment deals with the root of violence in communities. 

What the tenth commandment addresses imperceptibly is that that we always desire what _that one_ has, and _that one_ is usually one in proximity to us. This means that desire rests on the third party who puts value on the object; because the objects we desire always belong to our neighbor, it is the neighbor who renders them desirable. What is significant in all of this, is that our neighbor is a model for our desires. This is _mimetic desire_.

Where the scandal comes into play is when our neighbor gives opposition to our desire, for the object of my desire, he desires to keep for himself. In this sense, my neighbor inspires desire in me by providing to me a model of desire, and I inspire desire in my neighbor for what he already has, because he sees in me a model of desire. This exasperation of desire, if unchecked, can lead to _mimetic rivalry_, and is Girard's meaning behind the word _scandal_, borrowed from New Testament texts.

If this concept is so central to human behavior, why is it not mentioned in the New Testament? Girard's word for _scandal_ harkens to the teachings of Jesus, and he will argue in the next section that it plays a central role in Gospel discourse.
