We're getting outside a lot more these days to enjoy the sunshine. My daughter and I often go out during the evenings after work to enjoy a bike ride, which I know she enjoys. As you can see, there is still snow on the ground so we all have to bundle up.

Public parks and places are closed down. I stopped along the trail to snap a quick picture of a trailside park which has a sign warning people that it is not sanitized or safe to play.

If we have to go out at all, we use a mask. These masks were made by some of our good friends Adam and Jenna. As you can see, we're enjoying them a little too much, especially Nikki. It doesn't take much to entertain us these days.

Be deliberate about connecting with family and friends. Stay safe, and keep your distance from others. Wash your hands.
