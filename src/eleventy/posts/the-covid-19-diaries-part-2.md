I learned to cut my own hair this past week; it turned out ok. I was fortunate enough to have a clipper set and I have a simple-enough fade on the sides that I can probably skip a few haircuts. It has me thinking about what is truly necessary in life, and how much of our lifestyle is truly disposable. 

As with most people, we've cut back on our budget. We've decided that the most sensible way it to pay ourselves cash at the beginning of the month and just learn to be happy with what we have in hand to spend. We've done a month like this and so far is has worked well. The credit cards are now used for household spending. Anything beyond household needs, and that is for us or for our hobbies is paid in cash, and in some cases credit (with cash equivalent in the household jar). 

Family time has changed a lot. Ellie misses her nana and bumpa. We video chat with them sometimes, and other times we go for walks, and they're good about keeping 2m distance. I can see that it is hard on them not to have physical contact or even close proximity with the kids, but it's for the best. 

I have a somewhat morbid facisnation with tracking the growth of COVID-19. We've never experienced a pandemic before and it is astounding to have watched the virus grow in China, and finally breakout in Italy, Spain, Europe, and explode in the United States, which is now the global leader in case counts. Everyday I log <lbwc-a href="https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6">view the numbers</lbwc-a> and track them in a <lbwc-a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DvI_ckBmJbySp4usSMmVfRH5qD8riXJ4JiNTLxW34ew/edit?usp=sharing">spreadsheet</lbwc-a>. I suppose it helps ground me or make me feel like I'm on top of this situation which is out of our control, for the most part.

Be deliberate about connecting with family and friends. Stay safe, and keep your distance from others. Wash your hands. I'll be back with more.
