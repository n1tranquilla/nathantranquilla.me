    <p>I happened upon <em>Surprised by Hope</em> after first reading <em>How God became King</em>, another of N.T. Wright's books, which helped me understand the eschatological and theological framework that he works with, and in which he expounds the great hope of the Christian faith, which is the content of the present book. It is in <em>How God became King</em>, that he talks about the Kingdom of God; in <em>Surprised by Hope</em>, the resurrection; and in <em>The Day the Revolution Began</em>, the crucifixion, the last of which I am very excited to be reading and will soon follow up with a review. Being a difficult book to summarize, I will leave you with the thoughts that linger in my mind having finished reading the book.</p>
<p>What I have walked away with is wonderment and hope for this present world. Having understood that the resurrection of Jesus Messiah is a kind of ahead-of-schedule resurrection, or <em>firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep</em>, or a kind of present realization of God's future purposes in the present, or a kind of blueprint or promise of how God intents to renew the entire creation, an event marking a new age in which things are already beginning to be made new, that I now live with God's spirit in me, possessing the same essence of power that raised Jesus from the dead, and who lives in a body that death cannot touch - it is because of all of these thoughts that I'm excited at the possibilities of new life in me personally, and the possibility of being an agent of new life in my own community, in ways I hadn't previously imagined.</p>
<p>The question that really lingers for me is this: if God has already begun to realize his purposes for the future in the present through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, how might we also be used to realize God's plans for the future now, we who have been filled with the same Spirit?</p>
