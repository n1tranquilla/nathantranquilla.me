    <p>That all shall be saved is not a book to read without a dictionary near at a hand. David Bentley Hart's style philosophical style can be difficult to grok at times (pun absolutely intended).</p>
<p>His introduction is spent mostly casting doubt on some of the more traiditional justifications raised by proponents of infernalism amoung various sects of Christianity. He also clearly states his bias and warns the readers that he intends to unapolegitically state his points in favor of universalism. His confidence and style, i'm sure, come across as either confidence or arrogance, depending on which side of the debate you find yourself on.</p>
<p>The meat of the book unfolds in four meditations.</p>
<h2>Who is God? The moral meaning of <em>creatio ex nihilo</em></h2>
<p>The argument proceeds on implications of what it must mean for God to have created something from nothing (<em>ex nihilo</em>). If God creates from nothing, then what results must be good, since he cannot create evil.</p>
<p>In section II, he spends some time examining the qualities of God that we often attribute to Him and the inconsistencies that lie at the heart of various sects of Christian belief.</p>
<p>Section III and IV blend together in my mind, and form the culmination of this section which I will summarize as I understand it. The reasoning goes as follows: If God created something out of nothing, it has to be good because he cannot create evil. Obviously evil entered into creation that did not originate from God. If in the consummation of all things, some individuals are left to suffer interminably, that would an unspeakable evil or tragedy, ify ou prefer (God desires all men/women to come to the knowledge of the truth). Which would mean that, in the ages to come long after the redemption story is finished, and this blip in time has long passed, looking back at the story of creation and redemption, tragedy (or evil) came as a result God's creative act, which cannot be.</p>
<p>My summary no doubt leaves out much of the discussion and convincing parts of the argument.</p>
