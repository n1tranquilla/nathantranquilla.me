    <p>I See Satan Fall like lightning is first and foremost a anthropological study of biblical texts and Christian traditions. His goal is to show the unique role of the Gospel texts in exposing the parasite of satanic power on human order from the foundation of the first human society, through the persecution of the prophets, to finally the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. His method is to show the biblical tradition of exposing human violence in siding with, and telling of the story of the victim. In contrast, he shows that it is exactly the hidden story of the victim that otherwise produces mythology in the ancient world (there are a few examinations of myths). Girard finds in the Gospel narratives the secret hidden in mythology and human religious ritual - hidden violent social order resulting from rivalry between individuals and communities that periodically expels itself on a scapegoat victim. It is the revelation of violent social order inherent in the &quot;principalities and powers&quot; and the &quot;prince of this world&quot; found uniquely in the Gospel texts, that Girard uses to account for the modern disintegration of archaic religion and the modern concern for victims.</p>
<p>I will summarize each chapter of section one, as they are foundational to the rest of the book, and then sections two and three as a whole.</p>
<h2>Section 1: The biblical knowledge of violence</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1 <em>Scandal must come</em></h3>
<p>Girard begins with what the tenth commandment signals; the prohibition to covet what your neighbor has is to deal with desire directly. It is desire of what your neighbor has, or desire for what your neighbor desires, that produces rivalry in human communities. If rivalry goes unchecked, in threatens the peace of a community. And so the tenth commandment deals with the root of violence in communities.</p>
<p>What the tenth commandment addresses imperceptibly is that that we always desire what <em>that one</em> has, and <em>that one</em> is usually one in proximity to us. This means that desire rests on the third party who puts value on the object; because the objects we desire always belong to our neighbor, it is the neighbor who renders them desirable. What is significant in all of this, is that our neighbor is a model for our desires. This is <em>mimetic desire</em>.</p>
<p>Where the scandal comes into play is when our neighbor gives opposition to our desire, for the object of my desire, he desires to keep for himself. In this sense, my neighbor inspires desire in me by providing to me a model of desire, and I inspire desire in my neighbor for what he already has, because he sees in me a model of desire. This exasperation of desire, if unchecked, can lead to <em>mimetic rivalry</em>, and is Girard's meaning behind the word <em>scandal</em>, borrowed from New Testament texts.</p>
<p>If this concept is so central to human behavior, why is it not mentioned in the New Testament? Girard's word for <em>scandal</em> harkens to the teachings of Jesus, and he will argue in the next section that it plays a central role in Gospel discourse.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2: <em>The cycle of mimetic violence</em></h3>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to sketch out the late phases of <em>mimetic rivalry</em> and <em>mimetic contagion</em> in the Gospel discourse. The characters involved - the crowd, the disciples, and Peter, the religious leaders, the thieves, and Pilate himself - all succumb to the contagious hostility.</p>
<p>The crowd, who was favorable to Jesus upon his entry turn against him at he peak of the chaos. Peter, whose love is never in questions, is infected with the hostility. Pilate himself, whose motivations are to avoid a riot, understands that a victim must be given to pacify the crowd, and tries to offer up Barabbas, but yields Jesus in the end. The religious leaders, who seem to understand on some level that it is better for one person to die than a whole nation (a clue to the <em>all against all</em> nature of the conflict), look to deliver Jesus up as an insurrectionist. Even the thieves on the cross become infected by the mimetic contagion.</p>
<p>What exactly is going on here? What is the connection between mimetic desire and the lynching of Jesus in the Gospel narrative. We can imagine that beyond a certain threshold, the object of desire in a mimetic conflict can be forgotten and the individuals turn against each other. But we can also imagine that opportunistic antagonists can be found when an impasse is reached and the scandal between individuals gets caught up in a larger scandal.</p>
<p>I think this is the sketch that Girard is painting in the Gospel texts; the late stages of conflict between individuals, communities, and nations, so polarized that at the height of the conflict, they mobilize against a single individual to restore peace. And that is precisely what happens in the accounts - peace temporarily restored between rivals (Pilate and Herod, for example).</p>
<p>It is this banal, anthropological interpretation to the crucifixion of Jesus which makes sense of Jesus' own references to the resemblances to his death and that of all the prophets before him, including John the Baptist, which has striking mimetic resemblances (I will leave this for the reader). Think of his parable of the vineyard as well.</p>
<p>In the end, what we discover is the cycle of conflict and temporary peace that starts with mimetic desire and ends in the lynching of a victim. It is this false peace that is the discussion of the next chapter.</p>
<h3>Chapter 3: <em>Satan</em></h3>
<p>The satanic involvement in the cyclical nature of this process is discussed. Girard first notes that <em>Satan</em> and <em>scandals</em> are related to each other by none other than Jesus Christ himself &quot;Get behind me Satan, for you a <em>scandal</em> (translated stumbling block, or root word meaning &quot;to limp&quot; I believe) to me&quot;. It is precisely when Peter detects the fatalism in Jesus' words that he attempts to breathe desire into him, to be a model to Jesus himself, that Jesus rebukes him with the above remark. Jesus is already in imitation of his Father's will, and will not let his purpose degrade.</p>
<p>So what role does Satan play in the scandal. Girard uses Mark 3:23-26 &quot;How can Satan cast out Satan? ...&quot; to show that Satan indeed <em>does cast out Satan</em>. He does posses this power, for it is affirmed by Christ himself when he says his power is coming to and end, meaning it continues for now. For Satan does indeed protect his domain by virtue of its continued existence, and yet if he were purely a destroyer, Satan would have lost his domain long ago.</p>
<p>Satan, the seducer eventually becomes the adversary when desire becomes frustrated. When at the peak of these rivalries, the violence becomes a tinderbox of scandals, he sets off the single victim mechanism, to expel, to purify the community of the violence that threatens to destroy it. This victim is isolated, defenseless, different. It is someone the community unconsciously identifies. Unbeknownst to those involved, the sudden harmony, like the discord before it, is the work of contagious imitation. Just like in the gospel narratives, the shift of all against all, to all against one leads to a temporary peace between rivals.</p>
<p>There is an extensive discussion on John 8:42-44 which I will not go into here. It is sufficient to note the specific and technical associations between Satan, scandal, and his means of keeping order in a failing kingdom.</p>
<h2>Section 2: The enigma of the myth</h2>
<p>The purpose of this section is reveal the secret behind the origin of mythology. Girard finds in the writings of Philostratus and his account of Apollonius of Tyana, the missing link behind mythology of old and it's modern day disappearance. It is an incredible account of the stoning of a beggar, playing the ritual role of the <em>pharmakos</em> in the Dionysian cult, and his initial demonization, and transformation before the eyes of the people of Ephesus. The collective stoning is said to have brought a miraculous peace to the plague, which Girard understands to a be social disturbance that threatened the community's integrity.</p>
<p>Girard points out that the pattern of all mythology is much the same; extreme social disorder and sudden peace thanks to a god who is first the source of the communities problems and then the solution. Over time, he surmises that what was initially demonized fades by what is subsequently divinized, until what we mostly remember are the divine aspects. He surmises these gods are in fact victims who, at the height of mimetic crisis, are demonized, lynched, and in the sudden and perplexing peace that follows, is surmised to be divine and perhaps alive and responsible for the newly found peace of the community.</p>
<p>The origin of sacrifice follows quite easily from this. Research has found that practitioners would perform these sacrifices because it pleased the gods who founded them, and it restored social order. Could it be that they are repeating, as a matter of ritual, a primal sacrifice that is at the foundation of their social order?</p>
<p>Where do primitive cultures get the idea to ritualize sacrifice? Girard suggests that it is done in imitation of a founding murder in their mythology. He points out that the death of single victims producing institutions or religious systems is everywhere in mythology. A murder which brings such profound peace to a primitive society produces a myth. That myth produces ritualized sacrifice, in imitation of this founding murder in an attempt to achieve similar peace. Ritualized sacrifice evolves into religion, and religion evolves into human institutions. We should see this evolution as a single thread which at each stage is attempting to solve the same problem from the beginning; how to control human violence and keep the peace in human societies.</p>
<p>The story of Cain an Abel provides for us a great example, at least is part. We see a crisis which is resolved by Cain killing Abel. He leaves to found his own city, with a warning: if anyone murders, a ritualized sacrificial murder of seven other victims will follow. It is this string of murders, stretching all the way back to Abel, that the gospels seem to reference when speaking of the murders of Abel to Zechariah. Here we see the founding of a social order based on ritual sacrifice, but with one difference. Unlike other mythology, the violence of human cultures and institutions is exposed in the story of Cain and Abel, although the clearest exposure of what is at the heart of human social order and power will not come until the Gospel stories.</p>
<h2>Section 3: <em>The Victory of the Cross</em></h2>
<p>This section, with it's triumphal title, worried me coming out of the previous section. I found myself noting the similarities between Girard's myth and the Gospel stories. After all, was not Jerusalem a tinder box of political unrest and is not Jesus a convenient victim whose lynching postponed the destruction of Jerusalem? Was it not the religious leaders who recognized it was better for Jesus to die than the whole nation perish? Did not enemies become friends on the day Jesus became the scapegoat? Is not Jesus first identified as the problem, and demonized, only to be revealed as divine in the end of the story? What makes the gospels unique?</p>
<p>Girard starts by pointing out that the Bible has always sided with, and told the stories of victims. There is a brilliant comparison and contrast between the story of King Oedipus and the biblical story of Joseph. Noting the similarities, it is precisely where they diverge that we discover what makes the stories of the Bible unique. The majority doesn't write the history of Joseph; inevitably his brothers, had they told the story, would have painted Joseph to be wrong. Instead the Bible takes the side and tells the story of the victim, Joseph. It is this exposure that the reader gets to the story of the victim, which is never told in myths, that is unique, in the history of violence. But what it also unique is the refusal to make victims divine. In the story of Joseph, it is God's providence in the life of Joseph that is acknowledged, not the greatness or power of Joseph, although he holds sufficient position and power in the end that such a transformation is not hard to imagine to be possible.</p>
<p>To summarize briefly what makes the cross victorious is the representation of what has never truly been represented in history: the mimetic convergence of all against one and triggering of the single victim mechanism. It is precisely this exposition that empties Satan of its power.</p>
<p>We now see in the cross the disarming of the principalities and powers, having been made a spectacle themselves in the cross (Col. 2:14-15). How have they been made a spectacle? Because the source of Satan's power depends on it being shrouded in darkness but is now revealed in the crucifixion story and broadcast in four Gospel accounts to the the world.</p>
<p>It is in the prayer of Jesus on the cross (<em>Father, forgive them for they know not what they do</em>) that we not only see God's forgiveness but also the acknowledgement that they did not understand the power of which they were under. We also read in Peter's words in Acts the acknowledgement that what they did, both they and their leaders, was done in ignorance. Of what were they ignorant? The unconscious, contagious mimetic process causing them to all act against the person of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The satanic mechanism of contagious unanimous violence begins its reversal three days later, starting with the women in the garden, and then the disciples, and then to many others. The disciples, having succumbed to the contagion themselves, experience a sudden change of mind claiming to have seen the risen Christ. It is as if we witness Satan attempt to consume what is divine, only to expel what could never be consumed in the end. Truly, &quot;if the princes of this world had known [the wisdom of God], they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory&quot; 1 Cor 2:8. Indeed, because of the crucifixion, what was previously hidden and unconscious is now broadcast for all to see.</p>
<p>Even if we do not all understand this on a conscious level, because of Christ's solidarity with victims, we can no longer follow Jesus and ignore victims. His story is the story of all that have been victimized. Girard does discuss in the end of the book how the world has changed since crucifixion with regard to the disappearance of archaic religion. He spends some time probing into what scapegoating, although attenuated, looks like in our modern world. The last part, he discusses the modern concern for victims, and where it has come from. No surprises here, he ties it back to the Gospel narratives and spread of Christianity.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you decide to read this book, take the first three chapters slow; they are foundational to the rest of the book. I found this anthropological view of violence in the Bible and in the Gospel texts illuminating. Girard's perspective is fresh, and the definitions he assigns to some biblical texts have more meaning than I previously thought.</p>
