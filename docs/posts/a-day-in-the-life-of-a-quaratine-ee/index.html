    <p>We're getting outside a lot more these days to enjoy the sunshine. My daughter and I often go out during the evenings after work to enjoy a bike ride, which I know she enjoys. As you can see, there is still snow on the ground so we all have to bundle up.</p>

<p>Public parks and places are closed down. I stopped along the trail to snap a quick picture of a trailside park which has a sign warning people that it is not sanitized or safe to play.</p>

<p>If we have to go out at all, we use a mask. These masks were made by some of our good friends Adam and Jenna. As you can see, we're enjoying them a little too much, especially Nikki. It doesn't take much to entertain us these days.</p>

<p>Be deliberate about connecting with family and friends. Stay safe, and keep your distance from others. Wash your hands.</p>
