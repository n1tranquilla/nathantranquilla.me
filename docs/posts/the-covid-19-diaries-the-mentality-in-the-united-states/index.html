    <p>One of the truly perplexing phenomena of the COVID-19 pandemic is the reaction to quarantine measure I have witnessed in the United States. It seems to me, as an observer in Canada, that the reporting of events in the US paints a truly bizarre picture of human behavior. It is a behavior I have not seen in Canada on the same scale, nor have I read from news outlets in other countries. It's hard to put your finger on just why it is happening; maybe you know instinctively what I am nebulously referring to. It probably starts with fear, anxiety, and uncertainty about the future, but it has grown into protest, paranoia, distrust for governments, and complete disregard for public health.</p>
<p>Let's start with the numbers. It wasn't long ago that China was the epicenter of the virus. The virus quickly spread to Italy, Spain, and the rest of Europe. Lastly it spread to the Americas, where it has taken a foothold in the United States where it has become the new epicenter of the virus, leading in a first place position by a factor of four.</p>
<p>Being a remote worker for an American company, where my colleagues are Americans from various parts of the US, I have witnessed how slowly major cities have been to adopt defensive measures. For example, the province of New Brunswick was quick to implement quarantining and social distancing with only 10 cases province-wide. Today we have 118 cases province-wide, and have seen no growth in recent weeks. For contrast, in Washington DC, which had a couple hundred cases at the time, and is far more dense than New Brunswick, had not adopted any quarantine measures until recently, I believe.</p>
<p>Then came social media, where I learned that several of my wife's connections had ignored any social distancing measure during the Easter weekend, to enjoy meals with family and friends.</p>

<p>But the news outlets are reporting something even more sinister; paranoia and protests prevail in the United States, where participants are preaching their message of distrust against the World Health Organization and other &quot;theys&quot; and &quot;thems&quot; who are orchestrating the great take-down of the United States.</p>
<p>It is hard to explain why this is. I have often remarked before that American news has so much more fear-for-content than Canadian outlets; I have mistaken this for &quot;excitement&quot; in the past.The United States seems to exist in a media bubble, where citizens strongly distrust outside news sources, and recently for inside news sources that do not conform to the political views of the viewer. The partisan atmosphere following the impeachment of Donald Trump has only exacerbated this problem, as his can been a campaign of &quot;theys&quot; and &quot;thems&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's hope that our friends south of the border are able to overcome this mentality and focus on what is important during the pandemic - the public health.</p>
