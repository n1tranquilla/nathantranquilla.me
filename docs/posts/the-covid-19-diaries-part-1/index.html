    <p>Life is certainly much different than it was a month ago. One month ago I was making plans for a work trip to Virginia. One month ago the global case count for COVID-19 was less than 100,000 and mostly in China, while today the count is tenfold. One month ago, I was taking a bus to work, opening doors, pressing elevator buttons, and today we take trips to the superstore with gloves and sanitizer, wait in long line-ups with few people in them (paradox), and wash produce and loose change.</p>
<p>Life is just different now. Instead of getting up early and commuting to work, I get up later, and walk to my home office. When my work day is done, I leave my office and go upstairs. When I take breaks in the middle of the day, I get to see my wife and kids. Since all of my team members work in Virginia and British Columbia, not much has there.</p>
<p>Daycare is cancelled, as well as school until the end of the year. What I thought would be trying times has turned out to be a blessing. Ellie has made some break-throughs with her speech. She's saying A-B-C-D-E, as well as V-Y-Z and a smattering of letters in between. She's beginning to ask for things directly like veggie straws (straw), baby (for her little babies), as well as counting to 8. All of this is a bit of a surprise for us, considering the lack of structure. Finley has started walking too. Go figure.</p>
<p>We've been more deliberate with connecting with friends and family. We've video chatted with my sisters, neices and nephews, as well as Nikki's family, both immediate and extended. We've had several evenings where we've had virtual Netflix party's. One of my co-workers said he is attending a virtual birthday party this weekend.</p>
<p>Gas has plummetted to 70¢/L. I remember the price of gas being in the 80¢/L range once, and that was when I was sitting in my dad's car, drinking his coffee while he was filling the tank. I was probably a teen or pre-teen at that time. Stock markets have plummetted breaking records and there are layoffs all around, but we're doing ok. I've noticed some erratic behaviour, but I've also noticed deliberate, purposeful acts of kindness too, even if they are just kind messages, and check-ins from friends.</p>
<p>Be deliberate about connecting with family and friends. Stay safe, and keep your distance from others. Wash your hands. I'll be back with more.</p>
