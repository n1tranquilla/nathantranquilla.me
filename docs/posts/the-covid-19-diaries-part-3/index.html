    <p>What was all the hurry about anyway? You know what I mean... before quarantine. It seems like I was running around always in a hurry, always pushing the speed limit just a little, getting upset if I didn't make that yellow light. It seems like Saturdays were always a whilwind of inventory, meal-planning, going grocery shopping, keeping the kids entertained somewhere, often the mall, and then returning home to unpack and settle in for the afternoon. But with the restrictions, we've elected one of us as the shopper to minimize the chance of exposure.</p>
<p>It wasn't just weekends, it was weekdays too. Appointments, work, AIS, outings. I found myself driving my oldest around today, just to give my youngest a fighting chance at a nap, and realized how foreign the driver's seat felt; I hadn't driven in a couple weeks, according to my best recollection. But what was also striking too is how little of a hurry I was in to get... anywhere.</p>
<p>It's not just me having this realization either. I know for a fact others are prioritizing what is worth going out for and what isn't. The DECH is at 60% capacity right now, in anticipation of being flooded with patients, and the emergency room is empty, according to my mom who works there.</p>
<p>I wonder if we will rethink our healthcare system after this crisis is over. Yes we need better emergency preparedness for screening people coming into the country during a pandemic. But it also seems like some people are avoiding hospitals when they would otherwise have made a trip the the ER. It makes me wonder if there ought to be a base fee for services just to make people think twice about coming to the ER. This would have to be nominal in some way; free healthcare for all makes sense to me, but how to discourage needless visits remains an open question.</p>
