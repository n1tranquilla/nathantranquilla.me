        <lbwc-article title="What I am doing to overcome my plantar fasciitis" tags="" date="Apr. 16, 2020">
    <p>Plantar fasciitis is an inflammation of the fascia on the bottom of the foot, caused by overuse, and is injury that is present in a small percentage of active adults. My first experience with plantar fasciitis was caused by high-impact running, playing ultimate frisbee with new cleets on hard turf. My second experience was caused by doing some physio work attempting to address a knee injury, which involved some intense (too intense) stretching of the calves and achilles tendon, which put undue stress on the fascia of my foot.</p>
<h2>What does it feel like?</h2>
<p>Physically speaking, it comes on slowly and lingers for months. The pain has manifested in a variety of ways, depending on the stage of injury and recovery. At first, it felt like I had bruised my heel. At other times, it felt like I had a rock in my shoe. The pain seemed to shift from day to day to different areas of bottom of my foot. Sometimes it hurt the most in the morning and went away, and at other times, I felt it after being on my feet for a while.</p>
<p>Emotionally speaking, it can be very discouraging. It is an injury that takes time and rest to heal. During that time, it is hard to rest and stay off your feet as much as you can. You have to give up any form of high-impact exercise. My only saving grace during this time is that I've taken up weight lifting (not on my feet) which has kept me in shape, though perhaps not in a cardiovascular sense (debatable).</p>
<h2>What have I tried?</h2>
<p>It would seem that it is a chronic condition with me as it is my second experience in 3 years with the injury. My first experience seemed to last a few months, I remember, and was quickly overcome with a few weeks of physio work. My second experience has lasted 7 months so far, from fall of last year, until the spring of this one.</p>
<p>During this second time around, I resisted going to physio, and simply repeated the same routine I learned last time. After a month or two of this, I went to phsyio, which helped greatly. They use an ultrasound machine that does stimlate bloodflow to the tendon to promote healing. The injury, however did not seem to heal entirely. Thinking I was on the tail end of recovery, I went for a run which caused a flair-up of the injury.</p>
<p>The routine I learned this time around was to stretch the toes back against the wall, and calves as well. This is always accompanied by rolling the foot over a ball, or some kind of rolling device that helps massage the bottom of the foot. This is because the fascia will develop scar tissue as you continue to use your walk on an injured foot. This scar tissue needs to be broken down for proper healing.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I started massaging my own foot with my own hands that I realized there is tremendous amount of scar tissue on my foot as compared to the other. My left foot feels like bubble wrap as compared to the other. Massaging the bottom of the foot is painful in the moment but does not seem to aggravate my condition. On the contrary, I have made a lot of progress in the recovery by doing this. Time will tell if this truly helps.</p>
<p>Here is a list of things I have tried: physio, stretching, arch support , no arch support, night splints, rolling my foot with a tennis ball, rolling my foot with a spikey wooden ball, massaging my foot with my hands, compression socks, crying, blood letting, animal sacrifice. Just kidding about the last 3.</p>
<h2>What I am going to try to prevent this from happening again</h2>
<p>I will continue to do the stretching and massaging until I feel the foot has sufficiently recovered. At that point, I intend to try heel raises with a towel inserted under my toes. According to a <lbwc-a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.12313" role="link">new study</lbwc-a>, this applies load to the fasciia of your foot which strengthens it, and may prevent it from occuring again, although this should not be attempted if you experience pain immediately or the condition worsens over the next 24 hours.</p>
<p>This appears to be a chronic condition for me, so I will have to be careful. One thing I know for sure: I want to do whatever I can do ensure I never get this again. And if I am able to successfully get back on my feet again, I will never take for granted biking, running, roller-blading or walking (yes I cannot go for walks with my family right now) EVER again.</p>
