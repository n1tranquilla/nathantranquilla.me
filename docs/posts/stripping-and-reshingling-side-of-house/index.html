    <p>We have a tradition every Spring where we strip and re-shingle the side of the house. I say &quot;tradition&quot; because it is very much a ritual that starts in the Fall of the previous year and continues into the Winter until we do the work in the Spring. Each Fall we buy about 10-15 bundles of cedar shakes, which is enough to do one side, and let them dry into the Winter. In late Winter we paint and stack them in Dad's garage. Then comes the spring when we strip the side of the house, remove any rot, prepare the surface, and re-shingle.</p>

<p>The whole process takes about 2 weeks. This year, I took 1 week vacation and worked with Dad to strip, prepare, and re-shingle one section of the side of our house. Stripping usually takes a day for both sides. This year it took 2 days due to the unusually high temperatures this Spring. It took 3 days to prepare the surface, and 2-3 days to finish the one section. Dad almost entirely finished the second section by himself.</p>
